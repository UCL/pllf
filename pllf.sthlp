{title:Description}

{pstd}
{opt pllf} computes and plots the profile log likelihood function for a
single predictor in a regression model. The term "profile" implies
adjustment for other predictor(s) in the model, if any. It is assumed that
the likelihood function exists.

{pstd}
Plentiful general material on the PLLF is available on the Internet.
For example, search "google profile likelihood method".

{pstd}
{opt pllf} has two basic syntaxes, depending on which of the options
{opt profile()} or {opt formula()} is used. Let us call these
syntaxes 1 and 2.

{pstd}
With syntax 1, {opt profile()} must be specified and {opt formula()} is
not allowed. {it:regression_cmd_stuff} typically takes the simple form
[{it:depvar}] {it:varlist}, although more complex syntax is supported
according to the needs of {it:regression_cmd}. For example, for
{it:regression_cmd} {cmd:ivreg}, {it:regression_cmd_stuff} takes the form
{it:depvar} [{it:varlist1}] {cmd:(}{it:varlist2} {cmd:=}
{it:varlist_iv}{cmd:)}.

{pstd}
With syntax 1, {opt pllf} with the {opt profile()} option computes the
profile log likelihood (PLL) function for the regression coefficient
of a covariate defined by {cmd:profile(}{it:xvarname}{cmd:)} or a
parameter or variable defined by {cmd:profile(}[{cmd:[}{it:eqname}{cmd:]}]{it:paramname}{cmd:)}
within a model specified by {it:regression_cmd} {it:yvar} {it:xvarlist},
{it:regression_cmd_options}.
{opt pllf} also reports
PLL-based confidence limits, computed by a simple grid search.
{it:xvarname} does not have to be a member of {it:xvarlist}, although
it is harmless to include it. The results
are saved to new variables assigned by the {cmd:gen()} option.
The dataset length is increased if {cmd:n()} exceeds the number
of observations ({cmd:_N}).

{pstd}
With syntax 2, {opt formula()} and {cmd:range()}
must be specified and {opt profile()} is 
not allowed. {it:regression_cmd_stuff} is similar to that for
syntax 1, except that {it:regression_cmd_stuff} must include the
placeholder {cmd:X}. This is substituted by a variable calculated 
according to the formula defined by {opt formula()}, which must 
also include {cmd:X} at least once.

{pstd}
With syntax 2, {opt pllf} with the {opt formula()} option
computes the PLL function of a non-linear parameter denoted
by {cmd:X}. {cmd:X} is symbolically included where necessary
in {it:regression_cmd_stuff}. In effect, {cmd:X} is replaced on the fly
by the variable created by substituting the current value of {cmd:X} in
{it:formula}. {opt pllf} reports the MLE and PLL-based confidence limits,
computed by a simple grid search. Normal-based confidence limits
are not computed. Other features with syntax 2 are similar to
those with syntax 1.


{title:Options}

{p 2}{bf:Syntax 1}

{phang}
{cmd:profile(}{it:xvarname} | [{cmd:[}{it:eqname}{cmd:]}]{it:paramname}{cmd:)}
(
with syntax 1 is not optional. In the first format,
the PLL function for the regression
coefficient for {it:xvarname} is calculated. {it:xvarname}
is a covariate in the main response model.
In the second format, the PLL function for the parameter defined
by {cmd:[}{it:eqname}{cmd:]}{it:paramname} is calculated. Typically,
{it:paramname} will be an auxiliary parameter of some kind, such as
a scale or shape parameter, with its own 'equation'. For example,
for the Weibull model, {cmd:profile([ln_p]_cons)} would give
the PLL function for the log of the shape parameter, p.

{phang}
{opt range(#1 #2)} with syntax 1 evaluates the PLL function
over {it:#1} <= beta <= {it:#2}, where beta is the regression coefficient
for {it:xvarname}. Default is for {it:#1} and {it:#2} to be the
confidence limits for beta defined by the option {cmd:level()} and
the usual assumption of a normal distribution for beta_hat, the
maximum likelihood estimate of beta.

{p 2}{bf:Syntax 2}

{phang}
{opt formula(formula)} with syntax 2 is not optional.
{it:formula} defines
a transformation involving at least one variable in the dataset and the
parameter denoted by placeholder {cmd:X}.
{it:formula} may be any valid Stata expression.
Example: {cmd:formula(exp(-X*x5))}.

{phang}
{opt range(#1 #2)} with syntax 2 is not optional.
It evaluates the PLL function over {it:#1} <= {cmd:X} <= {it:#2},
where {cmd:X} is the non-linear parameter of interest. {opt pllf}
also seeks the MLE of {cmd:X}, but if the values of {it:#1 #2} are
ill-chosen or the PLL function behaves 'badly',
it may fail to find the MLE, or give an inaccurate estimate.
The most satisfactory situation is when the MLE lies between {it:#1}
and {it:#2}, and this may be judged from the plot of the PLL function.
In many cases, particularly with large sample sizes,
the PLL function is approximately quadratic with a single maximum.

{phang}
{opt placeholder(string)} defines the placeholder
character(s) used in syntax 2. Spaces or other punctuation
characters are not allowed. Default {it:string} is {cmd:X}
(capital-x).

{p 2}{bf:Evaluation options: both syntaxes}

{phang}
{opt dropcollinear} drops any collinear variables. The default is to 
stop with an error if the x variables are collinear.

{phang}
{opt level(#)} sets the confidence level to {it:#}; default is
{cmd:level(95)}.

{phang}
{opt maxcost(#)} sets an upper limit of 2 * {it:#}
on the number of additional evaluations
of the PLL, when searching for the PLL-based confidence limits. You
should rarely if ever need this option. The program is prevented
by {cmd:maxcost()} from cycling "for ever" when trying to find
confidence limits in pathological cases (see
{opt difference}. Default {it:#} is {cmd:n()}/2.

{phang}
{opt n_eval(#)} evaluates the PLL function at {it:#} equally spaced X values;
default is 100.

{phang}
{cmd:noci} suppresses calculation of the PLL-based confidence limits.

{p 2}{bf:Output options: both syntaxes}

{phang}
{opt deviance} requests minus 2 times the PLL function, i.e.
the profile deviance function. If {cmd:difference}
is also specified, {cmd:deviance} produces the profile deviance
difference, i.e. minus 2 times the PLL difference.

{phang}
{opt difference} computes the PLL function minus the maximised
log likelhood for the model. See also {cmd:deviance}. Except
in pathological cases, the resulting values are negative or zero.
Pathological cases denote likelihood functions with multiple maxima
or no maximum.

{phang}{opt eform}[{opt (string)}] reports results for the exponential of the 
coefficient. If {it:string} is specified then this is used as the parameter name.

{phang}
{opt gen(beta_var pll_var [pllnorm_var])} creates new variables:
{it:beta_var} to contain the values of the regression coefficient
over which the PLL is evaluated, {it:pll_var} to contain the PLL values, and 
(if {cmd:normal()} is specified) also {it:pllnorm_var} to contain the Normal 
approximation to the PLL values.
If {opt gen()} is not specified, the variables are created
with default names of {opt _beta}, {opt _pll} (and {opt _pllnorm}), respectively.

{phang}
{opt nodots} suppresses dots. By default, a dot is
displayed at each evaluation of the PLL.

{phang}{opt trace} displays the result of each log-likelihood evaluation.

{phang}{opt verbose} displays extended output including results of initial maximum likelihood fitting.

{p 2}{bf:Graph options: both syntaxes}

{phang}
{opt cilines(cline_options)} specifies the rendition of the vertical
lines representing the bounds of the profile-likelihood-based confidence
interval (CI).  See {help cline_options:{it:cline_options}}.

{phang}
{opt gropt(cline_options twoway_options)} supplies graph 
options to enhance the plot of the PLL (or a transformation of it)
against beta. The default graph is a line plot ({help twoway line})
showing the PLL-based confidence interval for beta as vertical lines
parallel to the Y-axis and the corresponding PLL value (or a
transformation of it) as a horizontal line parallel to the X-axis.
Appropriate linear transformation of the PLL is applied when the
{cmd:deviance} and/or {cmd:difference} options are specified.  For a more on
these options, see {help cline_options:{it:cline_options}} and 
{help twoway_options:{it:twoway_options}}.

{phang}
{opt levline(cline_options)} specifies the rendition of the horizontal
line showing the profile-likelihood at the confidence level for the the
profile-likelihood-based CI.  See {help cline_options:{it:cline_options}}.

{phang}
{opt mleline} adds a horizontal line at the MLE.

{phang}
{opt nograph} suppresses the line plot of the results.

{phang}
{opt shownormal}[{opt (line_options)}] adds a Normal approximation to the 
plot of the PLL. {it:line_options} are options valid for {help line}.


{title:Remarks}

{pstd}
The PLL function is used for two purposes: (1) to estimate likelihood-based
confidence intervals for parameters, and (2) to study the behaviour of the
likelihood function in pathological situations, i.e. when there is no
unique maximum or no maximum at all. Departure of the shape of the
PLL function from that of a quadratic indicates non-normality in the 
distribution of the parameter estimate of interest.

{pstd}
Note that sometimes, the MLE cannot be found at some values of the parameter
being profiled. In those cases, the maximization continues by default for
16000 iterations, and that can take a very long time. If the program appears
to "freeze" in this way, it is best to halt it by pressing ctrl/break. Then
restart it with a more suitable range of values (see the {cmd:range()}
option).

{pstd}
The pseudo standard error of beta or {cmd:X} is computed as
upper PLL confidence limit minus lower PLL confidence limit,
divided by twice t, where t is the appropriate quantile
of the t or normal distribution used in calculating normal
based confidence limits. When the sampling distribution of
the parameter of interest is close to normal, the usual standard
error and the PLL-based standard error will be approximately equal.

{pstd}
Some estimation commands do not return a log likelihood, that is, after
running the command, {cmd:e(ll)} is missing. Such programs may
return a log pseudo-likelihood in the form of a deviance, which is
defined as minus twice the log likelihood. When {cmd:e(ll)} is
missing and {cmd:e(deviance)} is non-missing, {cmd:pllf} utilizes the
log pseudo-likelihood, defined as -0.5*{cmd:e(deviance)}, for
estimating confidence intervals. An example is {cmd:binreg}; if
the {opt ml} option is not specified, it returns {cmd:e(deviance)}
but not {cmd:e(ll)}.

{p 2}{bf:Syntax 2}

{pstd}The following two commands with syntax 2 are equivalent and give

in exp(-X*x5).

{phang}. {stata "pllf, formula(exp(-X*x5)) range(.05 .25): stcox x1 x4a X x6 hormon"}{p_end}
{phang}. {stata "pllf, placeholder(@) formula(exp(-@*x5)) range(.05 .25): stcox x1 x4a @ x6 hormon"}

{pstd}

{opt formula(exp(-X*x5))} and the corresponding log likelihood values are determined.

{pstd}
In the second command, values of @ from {opt placeholder(@)} instead of X are used in
{opt formula()} and in the {cmd:stcox} model.

{pstd}
{opt pllf} stores in {cmd:r()}. Entries in which only beta is mentioned
apply only to syntax 1, otherwise to both syntaxes:
